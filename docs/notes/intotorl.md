# Intro to Reinforcement Learning  

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a subfield of machine learning that teaches an agent how to choose an action in its environment to maximize rewards over time. Unlike supervised learning, RL doesn't rely on labeled datasets; instead, the agent learns through interactions with its environment, using feedback from rewards to improve its decision-making over time.  

## Key Concepts  

- **Agent**: The program you train with the aim of performing a specified task.  
- **Environment**: The real or virtual world where the agent performs actions.  
- **Action**: A move made by the agent that causes a change in the environment.  
- **Rewards**: The evaluation of an action, which can be positive or negative.  
- **State**: A representation of the environment at a specific moment in time.  
- **Policy**: A strategy that defines the agentâ€™s behavior by mapping states to actions.  
- **Value Function**: Estimates the long-term reward for being in a particular state or taking a particular action.  
- **Q-Value (Action-Value)**: Estimates the total expected reward for taking a given action from a given state.  

## Difference Between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning  

- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled datasets where each input has a corresponding output to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns.  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Applies machine learning on unlabeled datasets that have no predefined labels or outputs, aiming to uncover hidden patterns in the data.  

### Key Differences  

1. **Static vs. Dynamic**  
   - Supervised and unsupervised learning focus on finding patterns in static training data.  
   - RL is dynamic, focusing on developing policies to guide the agent's actions at each step.  

2. **No Explicit Right Answer**  
   - In supervised learning, the "right answer" is provided by training data.  
   - In RL, the right answer isnâ€™t explicit â€” the agent learns through trial and error, relying on rewards to gauge progress or failure.  

3. **Exploration Required**  
   - Supervised and unsupervised learning derive answers directly from training data.  
   - In RL, the agent must explore the environment to discover new strategies for earning rewards.  

## OpenAI Gym  

- A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.  
- Provides a game-like environment where agents can take actions and learn from the outcomes.  
- After the agent takes an action, the environment updates its state, and the agent uses these changes to decide its next move.  

## Markov Process  

**Markov Property**: A process where the future state depends only on the present state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.  

- The state of **X** at time **t+1** depends only on the state of **X** at time **t**, making it independent of past states.  
- When the Markov Property is applied to a random process, it becomes a **Markov Chain** â€” a model that describes a sequence of possible events where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.  

### Markov Equation  

The probability of transitioning from state **s** to state **s'** after taking action **a** is given by:  

\[
P(s' | s, a) = Pr(S_{t+1} = s' \mid S_t = s, A_t = a)
\]

Where:  
- \( S_t \) = State at time **t**  
- \( A_t \) = Action taken at time **t**  
- \( S_{t+1} \) = State at time **t+1**  

### Bellman Equation (Optional but Important)  

In RL, the **Bellman Equation** is crucial for understanding value functions. It expresses the relationship between the value of a state and the values of its successor states:  

\[
V(s) = \mathbb{E} [ R + \gamma V(s') ]
\]

Where:  
- \( V(s) \) = Value of being in state **s**  
- \( R \) = Reward received after transitioning from **s** to **s'**  
- \( \gamma \) = Discount factor (0 â‰¤ Î³ â‰¤ 1), representing the importance of future rewards  

## Important Notes on Reinforcement Learning  

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The agent must balance between exploring new actions to find better rewards and exploiting known actions to maximize immediate rewards.  
- **Delayed Rewards**: Actions can have long-term consequences, making it essential to consider future rewards, not just immediate feedback.  
- **Credit Assignment Problem**: Determining which actions contributed to the rewards received can be challenging, especially when rewards are delayed.  
- **Training Process**: RL typically involves running episodes where the agent repeatedly interacts with the environment, gathering experience and refining its policy.
