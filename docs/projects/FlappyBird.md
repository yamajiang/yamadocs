#Flappy Bird

This project was my first experience diving into game design. I experimented with Unity and created a pink-themed Flappy Bird game using C# and designed all the graphics myself. It was an exciting introduction to game development, where I learned about physics, collision detection, and user input handling. This project sparked my interest in building interactive experiences and gave me a great learning foundation for future game design endeavors.
