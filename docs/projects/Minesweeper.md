#Minesweeper

I love playing Minesweeper, so it inspired me to create my own clone of the classic game using Java. This project involved building the game logic from scratch, handling grid generation, mine placement, and implementing the rules for uncovering tiles and flagging mines. It was a fun challenge that deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming, game development, and algorithm design while recreating a game Iâ€™ve always enjoyed.
